# Serverless

We're using the serverless from work for deployment

```
sls deploy
```
But [Kurt Hutten](https://github.com/Irev-Dev) is the only one with credentials for deployment atm, though if you wanted to set your own account you could deploy to that if you wanted to test.

## Testing changes locally

You'll need to have Docker installed

Because of the way the docker containers to be deployed as lambdas on aws are somewhat specialised for the purpose we're using `docker-compose` to spin one up for each function/endpoint. So we've added a aws-emulation layer


Then cd into this folder `cd api/src/docker` and:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The first time you run this, it has to build the main image it will take some time, but launching again will be quicker.

After which we'll also spin up a light express server to act as an emulator to transform some the request from the front end into how the lambda's expect them (This emulates the aws-api-gateway which changes tranforms the inbound requests somewhat).
```
yarn install
yarn emulate
```
You can now add OPENSCAD_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" to you .env file and restart your main dev process (`yarn rw dev`)
comment that line out if you want to go back to using the aws endpoint (and restart the dev process).

If you change anything in the `api/src/docker/openscad` directory, you will need to stop the docker process and restart it (will be fairly quick if you're only changing the js)
