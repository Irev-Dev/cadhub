title: OpenSCAD Previews
---

you may have noticed that the 3d viewer for OpenSCAD is not fully live. changing perspective of the camera takes a moment before the model updates.

The reason for this is that what's shown is not a 3d asset but instead an image generated by OpenSCAD from the same perspective as the in browser camera.
This is done to show a preview as quickly as possible as it can take OpenSCAD much longer to product full 3d file (often minutes) than it does to create a preview image (a few seconds).
