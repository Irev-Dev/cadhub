title: Why OpenSCAD
---

OpenSCAD is a Code-CAD, which means models are made from a code script rather than from a series of clicks in a user interface.
If you want an un-bias opinion on if this is a good paradigm you'll have to look elsewhere because we/CadHub are massive advocates for it.

A quick run down is that you get all the benifits of git version control. It makes reusing cad logic with a team much easier, and if you think of CAD models as a communication medium between colleagues and machines, what better way of storing it than in an auditable script.

We're going to learn OpenSCAD now over [the alternatives](/blog/curated-code-cad) because not only is it very mature and stable, it's also easy to pick up. Let's get started!
