# Why I started CadHub

Like many, OpenSCAD was my portal into the world of CodeCAD. Once I started making parts with deterministic scripts there was no going back. That doesn't mean that I wasn't frustrated by certain things, a big one for me was how difficult fillets and chamfers can be with OpenSCAD. So much so, I was driven to [create a library](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Round-Anything) to help with this and I even contemplated creating my own Code-CAD tool/language, in particular I was interested in introducing [sketch mechanics](https://github.com/zalo/CascadeStudio/pull/56).

Ultimately it was seeing how [many different projects](/blog/curated-code-cad) there were for this style of CAD and yet there was no central home for them all that I decided that the best way to contribute to the community was to make a hub for our projects.

## The road map
Because the focus is on Code-CAD, we can introduce some awesome features that leverage the best the paradigm has to offer, like github integration or embed-able Customizers. Check out the [road-map](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/cadhub/discussions/212) if you interested in what we have planned.
