CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python library for building parametric 3D CAD models. It has several goals:

- Build models with scripts that are as close as possible to how youâ€™d describe the object to a human, using a standard, already established programming language
- Create parametric models that can be very easily customized by end users
- Output high quality CAD formats like STEP and AMF in addition to traditional STL
- Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and executed with only a web browser
