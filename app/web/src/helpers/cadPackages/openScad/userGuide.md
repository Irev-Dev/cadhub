OpenSCAD is a solid 3D modeler that enables the creation of parametric models using its scripting language. Models are created by utilizing a technique called constructive solid geometry. With this technique, simple objects can be transformed and combined in order to create almost any complex model.

A good place to start is the [docs](https://openscad.org/documentation.html), and the [cheatsheet](https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/) is an excellent reference.
